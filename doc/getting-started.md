## Setting up Icinga 2 with Ansible roles

### Setting up Icinga2 headless

Assuming that you have Ansible already installed and configured, move to a directory of your choice and clone the **icinga2-ansible** repo:

`git clone https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2-ansible.git`

Append the path where you have cloned the repository to your **.ansible.cfg** _roles_path_. In this example we are assuming that you have cloned the repo in your home directory:

`roles_path=/etc/ansible/roles:~/icinga2-ansible`

Create an inventory file and place your monitoring servers entries inside:

```ini
[monitoring_servers]
icinga_one ansible_host=1.2.3.4 ansible_user=root
```

Now create a playbook to hold instructions for Ansible, let's call this file `site.yml`:

```yaml
---
- hosts: monitoring_servers
  roles:
   - role: icinga2-ansible-no-ui
     icinga2_conf_global: |
       include "constants.conf"
       include "zones.conf"
       include <itl>
       include <plugins>
       include "features-enabled/*.conf"
       include_recursive "conf.d"
     check_commands:
       check_nrpe: |
          "-H", "$address$",
              "-c", "$remote_nrpe_command$",
  tags: icinga2-no-ui
```

Save the file and close, then launch the playbook with Ansible:

`ansible-playbook site.yml -i inventory.ini`

During the execution the role will take care of all the tasks required to install and configure Icinga2 with Plugins.

### Setting up Icinga2 alongside IcingaWeb2 UI

After Icinga2 is up and running you can move forward to add IcingaWeb2 UI. Please note that IcingaWeb2 requires EPEL and Mysql/MariaDB, therefore such dependencies should be installed separately. Open up the playbook with your favorite text editor and add the role for IcingaWeb2 UI:

```yaml
---
- hosts: MonitoringServers
  roles:
     ## Please note: this role is not included and it is listed here for clarity only
   - role: epel-repo
     tags: epel

     ## Please note: this role is not included and it is listed here for clarity only
   - role: mariadb
     mariadb_yum_repos: |
       [MariaDB]
       name=MariaDB
       baseurl=https://yum.mariadb.org/5.5/centos6-amd64
       gpgkey=https://yum.mariadb.org/RPM-GPG-KEY-MariaDB
       gpgcheck=1
     tags: mariadb

   - role: icinga2-ansible-no-ui
     icinga2_conf_global: |
       include "constants.conf"
       include "zones.conf"
       include <itl>
       include <plugins>
       include "features-enabled/*.conf"
       include_recursive "conf.d"
     check_commands:
       check_nrpe: |
          "-H", "$address$",
              "-c", "$remote_nrpe_command$",
     tags: icinga2-no-ui

   - role: icinga2-ansible-web2-ui
     icinga2_db_pass: "CHANGEME"
     icinga2_web2_db_pass: "CHANGEME"
     icinga2_ido_mysql_configuration: |
       library "db_ido_mysql"

       object IdoMysqlConnection "ido-mysql" {
         user = "{{ icinga2_db_user }}"
         password = "{{ icinga2_db_pass }}"
         host = "localhost"
         database = "{{ icinga2_db }}"
       }
     tags: icinga2-ansible-web2-ui

```

Save the file and close, then launch the playbook with Ansible as usual:

`ansible-playbook site.yml -i inventory.ini`

During the execution the role will take care of all the tasks required to install IcingaWeb2 UI with IDO. At the end of the installation you are required to generate a token with `icingacli` and to visit http://IP//icingaweb2/setup in order to proceed with the configuration of IcingaWeb2 UI. Please take note that **icinga2-ansible-web2-ui** does not install Icinga2, and must be used after **icinga2-ansible-no-ui**.

### Setting up Icinga2 alongside Classic UI

After Icinga2 is up and running you can move forward to add a Classic UI. Open up the playbook with your favorite text editor and add the role for Classic UI:

```yaml
---
- hosts: monitoring_servers
  roles:
   - role: icinga2-ansible-no-ui
     icinga2_conf_global: |
       include "constants.conf"
       include "zones.conf"
       include <itl>
       include <plugins>
       include "features-enabled/*.conf"
       include_recursive "conf.d"
     check_commands:
       check_nrpe: |
          "-H", "$address$",
              "-c", "$remote_nrpe_command$",
     tags: icinga2-no-ui

   - role: icinga2-ansible-classic-ui
     icinga2_classic_ui_passwd: 'CHANGEME'
     tags: icinga2-classic-ui
```

Make sure  to replace CHANGEME with your desidered password for user **icingaadmin**.

Save the file and close, then launch the playbook with Ansible as usual:

`ansible-playbook site.yml -i inventory.ini`

During the execution the role will take care of all the tasks required to install and configure Icinga2 Classic UI. Please take note that **icinga2-ansible-classic-ui** does not install Icinga2, and must be used after **icinga2-ansible-no-ui**.

### Setting up Icinga2 alongside Web UI

After Icinga2 is up and running you can move forward to add a Web UI. Open up the playbook with your favorite text editor and add the role for Web UI:

```yaml
---
- hosts: monitoring_servers
  roles:
   - role: icinga2-ansible-no-ui
     icinga2_conf_global: |
       include "constants.conf"
       include "zones.conf"
       include <itl>
       include <plugins>
       include "features-enabled/*.conf"
       include_recursive "conf.d"
     check_commands:
       check_nrpe: |
          "-H", "$address$",
              "-c", "$remote_nrpe_command$",
     tags: icinga2-no-ui

   - role: icinga2-ansible-web-ui
     icinga2_web_ui_ido: "mysql"
     tags: icinga2-web-ui
```

At this moment, the role have only support for Mysql IDO Backend.

Save the file and close, then launch the playbook with Ansible as usual:

`ansible-playbook site.yml -i inventory.ini`

During the execution the role will take care of all the tasks required to install and configure Icinga2 Web UI. Please take note that **icinga2-ansible-web-ui** does not install Icinga2, and must be used after **icinga2-ansible-no-ui**.

After Icinga2 is up and running with your favorite UI, you can move forward to [add host checks](https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2-ansible/blob/master/doc/adding-hosts.md).
